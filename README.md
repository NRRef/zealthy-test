## Comments to evaluator

Hi, I developed the solution thinking in the A/B tests and how make it easier. Because of it, there is a forms list screen, so it allows create multiple forms at the same time.

The initial screen is suposed to be a sign in screen, but I have not developed the login features. 

I tried to use many concepts to show examples of usabilty, and there are many possibilities to improve the solution, like adding a constants file, multiple themes, exception treatment and error/success screens and tests. My intention was keep the solution simple but presenting some possibilities.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
